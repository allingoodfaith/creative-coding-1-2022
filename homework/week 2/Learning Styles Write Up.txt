Learning Styles feels like it would look in theory, but maybe it feels a little too good to be true. Maybe it has something to do with how hyper individual the US is in it culture and that we want to feel like our education can be catered to each person, but there are some ways that can remain consistent between people.I think there are grounds to say that people can take in information in different ways, example reading vs listening, but that does not give ground to base your entire education off of a preferred way of gaining information. It might even be better to actively avoid learning style so that you are flexible with how you learn. Life won’t always cater to your specific learning style but being able to still learn regardless is important.
