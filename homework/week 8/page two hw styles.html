        <h1>Valentine's Day Gift for my Partner</h1>
            <img src="happyvalentinesdayhoney.jpg" width="400" height="400"/>
            <p>This was a gift I made for my parnter for this most recent Valentine's day</p>
            <p>They introduced me to Demon Slayer which is what this peice is based off of with characters they designed as Demon Slayer</p>
            <p>It was fun seeing how to translate thier modern designs into something more akin to the show's designs </p>

        <title>>My most recent completed Work </title>
            <img src="yasqueen.jpg" width="400" height="450"/>
            <p>This was part of a 'dtiys' or a do this in your own style challange</p>
            <p>The goal of this challange is take insperation form the contest holder work and then create a peice that takes insperation form it</p>
            <p>Depending on the rules of the challange, which are set but the holder, they can be very open</p>
            <p>For me these challanges offer some good practice as I can focus on certain parts of the piece without needing to think to much on the rest</p>
